# 🧘‍♂️ ZenApp – Meditation App Landing Page

Welcome to **ZenApp**, a landing page project built to **practice and strengthen HTML and CSS skills**.

This is a fictional meditation app landing page designed to simulate a real-world product promotion website, just like those used by companies to showcase their digital apps or services.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to **learn, practice, and apply** core web development concepts using plain HTML and CSS. Through this project, I focused on:

- Semantic structure with HTML5  
- Responsive layouts using media queries  
- Flexbox and CSS Grid  
- Typography and spacing techniques  
- Clean and modern UI design  
- Component-based structure  
- Good code organization practices  

## 📱 Layout & Features

The ZenApp landing page includes:

- **Hero section** with logo, headline, description, and call-to-action button  
- **Benefits section** showcasing app features  
- **User testimonials** (fictional)  
- **App mockup and visuals**  
- **Download CTA section**  
- **Footer** with links and social media icons  

> The design is fully responsive and works well on mobile and desktop screens.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Google Fonts (for custom typography)  
- Illustrative images and icons (for educational use only)

## 📚 What I Learned
